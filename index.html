                    <h2>"The Mysterious Island" by Jules Verne</h2>
                    <p>
                        I read this book in middle school and liked it immediately after the first chapter.
                        The novel tells about people who are stuck on a desert island after a balloon crash. 
                        The main characters apply their scientific knowledge and technical skill to survive in the island. 
                        This book has an intriguing mystery story about the island and it's secrets.

                    <h2>"The Chrysalids" by John Wyndham</h2>
                    <p>
                        I found this book in the bookstore near my house and I liked the brief description of the story on the cover.
                        The main character (David) sees strange dreams that he is forced to hide from his district. He is a telepath, but he is not alone. 
                        This book not only about telepathy, but freedom of thought and speech.

                    <h2>"The Day of the Triffids" by John Wyndham</h2>
                    <p>
                        I saw a science fiction film "The Day of the Triffids" when I was a kid. 
                        And only a few years ago I decided to read a book and I really liked it.
                        The main character (Bill), bandages over his wounded eyes, misses the spectacular meteorite shower in England. 
                        Removing his bandages the next morning, he finds that all people lost their sight except him. 
                        But soon he will find people who also didn't lose sight and together they will look for the cause of the disaster.

                    <h2>"The Three Musketeers" by Alexandre Dumas</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was reading this book in elementary school and at the same time was watching a show based on this book.
                        It's a historical romance about France in 17th century, musketeers, friendship, love and devotion. 
                        The book will tell story about Dâ€™Artagnan and his musketeers friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.

                    <h2>"The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde</h2>
                    <p>
                        First I watched a film by Oliver Parker and then I read a book and liked it more.
                        The main idea of The Picture of Dorian Gray is the relationship between beauty and morality.
                        The reader will get acquainted with the main character who will turn from an ordinary guy into an arrogant and narcissistic person.

                    <h2>"Lord of the Flies" by William Golding</h2>
                    <p>
                        I learned about this book in my first year at the university, when my classmate brought it to a lecture.
                        This is a story about a group of boys who are stuck on a deserted tropical island without adults.
                        This story shows how important to live in accordance with the rules and to have a smart leader. 
                        Events taking place with the guys on the island show the horror of what happens when people begin to live without rules, arranging a hunt for each other.
